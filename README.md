Hello everyone.

This program is barebones, just a proof of concept that it works, if you're working on a similar project, and new to all of this, hopefully my
repo will be useful for you.

RcControlpanel - This will connect to the Raspberry pi, use this on Windows/Linux

RPi_Server - Have this on Raspberry pi

Here is list I need to add
1. Run on startup
2. Handle when client disconnects, and listen for new connection.
3. add led as headlights
4. add rpi camera

Model of Raspberry Pi:
Raspberry model B Rev 2 with latest wheezy

If you have any trouble, you can reach out to me, and I will do my best to help.
