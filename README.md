Hello everyone.

This program is barebones, just a proof of concept that it works, if you're working on a similar project, and new to all of this, hopefully my
repo will b useful for you.


Here is list I need to add
1. Run on startup
2. Handle when client disconnects, and listen for new connection.
3. add led as headlights
4. add rpi camera


If you have any trouble, you can reach out to me, and I will do my best to help.
